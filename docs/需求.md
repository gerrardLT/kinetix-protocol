Kinetix Protocol MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Vision: The first yield-bearing prediction layer on Somnia, maximizing capital efficiency.
Introduction & Problem Statement
1.1. Overview
Kinetix Protocol is a decentralized prediction market built on the Somnia blockchain. It allows users to speculate on the outcomes of future events.
1.2. Problem
In standard prediction markets, capital used for betting remains idle and unproductive until the market is resolved. This creates an opportunity cost for users, as their funds are not generating yield.
1.3. Solution
Kinetix Protocol solves this by integrating with Somnia's native DeFi ecosystem. When users place a bet, their funds are automatically deposited into yield-generating protocols. This ensures that capital is always productive. Winners receive their payout plus the accumulated yield, enhancing returns and overall capital efficiency.
Core Features (MVP Scope)
2.1. Prediction Markets
Functionality: Create and display binary (YES/NO) prediction markets.
Details: Each market will have a clear resolution event and source of truth (e.g., a price oracle).
User Interaction: Users can view a list of active markets, see current odds/payouts, and view historical data.
2.2. Betting Mechanism
Functionality: Users can place bets on "YES" or "NO" outcomes using SOMI tokens.
Backend Logic: The smart contract will lock the user's funds in the market's vault.
2.3. Automated Yield Generation
Functionality: All funds held within the market vaults are automatically routed to a designated Somnia DeFi protocol (or a staking pool) to generate yield.
Technical Note: For the MVP, this can be a simulated "Mock Yield" contract that predictably increases the value of assets to demonstrate the feature effectively.
2.4. Real-Time Data Integration with Somnia Data Streams (SDS)
Key Value Proposition: This is the core technical showcase for the hackathon.
Functionality: The frontend will use the Somnia Data Streams (SDS) SDK to receive live, streaming updates directly from the blockchain.
User Experience Impact:
Live Pool Sizes: Total liquidity and potential payouts for each market update instantly as new bets are placed, without needing to refresh the page.
Dynamic APY: The current yield generation rate (APY) is displayed as a live metric.
Real-Time Activity Feed: A log of recent bets can be shown to users as they happen.
2.5. Market Resolution and Payout
Functionality: Once an event's outcome is determined (via an oracle or manual resolution for the MVP), the market is settled.
Payout Logic:
Winners receive their original stake, their share of the winnings from the losing side, and all the yield generated by both sides during the market's duration.
Losers forfeit their stake.
3. User Flow
Connect Wallet: User connects their Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the dApp and switches to the Somnia Testnet.
Browse Markets: User views the main dashboard with a list of available prediction markets.
Select Market: User clicks on a market to view detailed information, including the current odds and total liquidity.
Place Bet: User chooses a "YES" or "NO" outcome, enters the amount of SOMI they wish to bet, and confirms the transaction in their wallet.
View Position: User can navigate to a "My Portfolio" page to see their active bets and the current value.
Claim Winnings: After a market has been resolved, winning users can return to the market page or their portfolio to claim their payout.
4. Technical Stack
Frontend Framework: Next.js (with App Router)
UI Components: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI for a modern, clean interface.
Blockchain Interaction: wagmi & viem for wallet connection and contract interactions.
Real-Time Data: Somnia Data Streams (SDS) SDK.
Smart Contracts: Solidity
Target Network: Somnia Testnet
5. Out of Scope for MVP
User creation of new markets.
Complex governance features or a protocol token.
Support for multiple collateral types (SOMI only).
Advanced order books or trading features.
Mobile-native application.
